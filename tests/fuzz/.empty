I use Dr. Proebsting's rdgen to create random Orng programs.
```sh
# Example of creating random programs, and then running tests over those program
./create-fuzz.sh
./run-fuzz.sh
```
But the fuzz.txt and the output files are huge and change often, so are gitignored so as not to clutter each commit with noise.

Git doesn't track empty files, so this file is here to let people know that fuzz tests are indeed done here in tests/fuzz/

The testing philosophy is that integration tests ensure that the Orng compiler works with expected input, and the fuzz tests ensure that the compiler properly handles unexpected input.
