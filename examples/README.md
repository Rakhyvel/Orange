# `examples/`
This directory contains Orng programs that exemplify features I hope Orng will one day be able to compile (almost there!)

* For Orng programs that currently do compile, take a look at [`tests/integration/`](https://github.com/Rakhyvel/Orng/tree/main/tests/integration). Output C files can be found in [`tests/integration/build/`](https://github.com/Rakhyvel/Orng/tree/main/tests/integration/build).
* To see the grand roadmap forward, take a look at [`todo.md`](https://github.com/Rakhyvel/Orng/tree/main/todo.md).
