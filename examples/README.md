# `examples/`
This directory contains Orng programs that exemplify features I hope Orng will one day be able to compile (almost there!)

* For Orng programs that currently do compile, take a look at `tests/integration/`. Output C files can be found in `tests/integration/build/`.
* To see the grand roadmap forward, take a look at `todo.md`.
